This repository is for Robin Jack's project for the part-time MSC 
in Computer Science at Birkbeck.

This readme currently contains some rough thoughts 
about the possible things we could do.

In general, the goal will be to complete and small project 
and learn how to use Flask through this process. Then, once

Ideas:
1. site where people pay, and at the end of each day, whoever

2. WTF shouldI eat for dinner - redo it
3. Site that tells you what you should wear according to your

Backend (more ambitious ideas): 
1. Site to play a game against someone else (i.e. typing speed)
2. 



FIRST PROJECT
LEARN FLASK + GET SOMETHING UP AND RUNNING ON ROBINJACK.COM
