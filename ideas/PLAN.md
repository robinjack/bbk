OVERALL plan

What am I building?
1. A DSL for analysing the data of the world bank (as documented here https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589-developer-information)
2. A way of downloading and integrating new data into this data


What are the steps:

Background research:
1. Do some general research on DSLs. Write up a summary of what they are, how they can help with this problem. Come up with a list of considerations when designing DSLs (i.e. do I use a parser generator, )
2. Consider the technologies I could use (i.e. databases, programming languages, different DSL techniques)
3. General research / summaries on popular data analysis tools (i.e Pandas, R)

Presentation of problem / plan + solution
Explain the problem: lots of people want to analyse the data, but need a developer to get it. The idea of this tool will be to: 
1. Enable people to obtain the data they require and want to download
2. Manipulate it into a format they desire
3. Analyse it using an easily understood grammar 
 


Plan for developing solution

1. Review the world bank's data. Do some cursory data modelling to figure out what could be possible
2. Write up potential approaches to creating a DSL for the world bank's data
* What database am I going to use to store the data locally? Will I even use a database?
* What language will I use?
* What method of creating a DSL will I use? etc
