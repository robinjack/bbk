#A DSL FOR DATA ANALYSIS

##Background research
The student shows a clear understanding of the researched material. Potential approaches are reviewed and critically evaluated, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of each.




##Presentation of problems - aims and objectives
Presentation of problem – aims and objectives: A challenging problem is specified and clearly outlined: this includes its context and the technical/user requirements. 




##Plan for developing the solution:
 An appropriate development/research method is chosen and its suitability is well-justified. The project is broken down into subtasks that are logically coherent. In the case of unknowns (e.g. open research questions) “fallback” plans are laid out.


##Presentation of the proposal

Complex issues are explained clearly and concisely. The content is well-organised and structured in a way that demonstrates the links between the concepts presented. The proposal/report shows that the student clearly understands the researched material. The solution and any other claims made by the students are well-justified. The author uses various resources and cites relevant resources using an appropriate consistent referencing style. The proposal/report is of professional quality and contains very few, ideally no, typographic errors.
